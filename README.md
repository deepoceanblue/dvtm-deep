my fork of dvtm terminal multiplexer.

Small changes to adjust it to how my other apps are set up:

  - changed colorscheme
  - q now kills pane
  - Q exits dvtm
  - z/Z are used for zoom


Apart from occasional experimenting with settings virtually no changes
are made to here---it is created just to have online access to my settings.
